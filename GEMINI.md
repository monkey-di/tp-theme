## Gemini Added Memories
- User prefers Russian language for communication and documentation.
- The user provides HTML automatically exported from design tools, which may contain issues like absolute positioning. I should treat it as a visual reference but refactor it into clean, responsive code (using Flexbox/Grid) and always add BEM classes alongside Tailwind utilities for custom styling.
- User prefers to store contextual and temporary files like TODO.md in a .context/ directory within the project root.
- The mobile layout is currently in a prototype state and requires further refinement; it is not yet fully completed.
- The user prefers SVG for icons, site logo, and arrows, and raster images for content (e.g., photos). I should use inline SVG for simple graphics and the main logo for scalability and clarity.
